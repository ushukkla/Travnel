## A mobile application for commuting in public buses

## Following are the features of the application, some are done, some are which I am still working on, 

[1] Dynamic e-ticketing functionality which plans and books the entire journey of the end user thereby eliminating paper ticket and hard cash.

[2] It provides the real time GPS location of the buses to the end user.

[3] Accurate ETA (estimated time of arrival) of the bus and rescheduling alerts.

[4] Alert the end user about the no. of vacant seats available in the bus and crowd details.

[5] There will be a “panic” button in the application, especially for the women. It will provide the functionality of one touch call to the nearest police station in any adversity.

[6] Various policies and offers regarding e-ticketing will be available so that we can motivate users to travel more in the public buses rather than taking any other means of transportation.

[7] Through this application we will be transferring the money being generated through the tickets, directly into the government’s bank account on a daily basis.

[8] Application would consist of security and transparency through blockchain (in application).

[9] Loosing of ticket, deception in buying tickets and other problems can be eliminated through e-ticketing.
